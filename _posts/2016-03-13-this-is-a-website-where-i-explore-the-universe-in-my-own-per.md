This is a website where I explore the universe in my own perspective and share it with you, that would be anyone who comes to my site.  I believe your, body and your mind is a universe within itself that is a part of the creation of your world.  What you think and feel creates your world a concept that is becomming more understood and accepted.  How does what I share here contribute to other peoples lives?  If we are all one and what each of us create in our lives affects the whole, then sharing your experiences and understandings of your life can help others see things that they may have not seen before and ultimatley make the choice to bring that into their experience.  Each one of us make choices at every moment in life, these choices can change how you see your world.  If you don't seek out new choices, you don't grow.  I hope this website shows my growth and understanding of how the universe works for me and how my growth in this understanding has made a beautiful and abundant life with still a lot of change to be had.  We are here on this earth to learn and learn who we are really are and the journey to ascend within and to learn who we really are.  ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/bd84255d-96e1-497e-8ff0-872faea5ad5a.jpg)
